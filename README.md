# Record-Collector
Sinatra app for organizing a record collection

#Setup

To use this app, clone, run `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.

#Usage

Once you've created an account, you'll be brought to your home page, which displays all the records in your collection. Records can be added by selecting titles from the Record Collector community database (click "RC Database" in the upper-left corner) or by clicking "Add New Record." You can navigate back to your home page at any time by clicking "Your Collection" in the upper-left corner, or log out by clicking Log Out in the upper-right corner.
